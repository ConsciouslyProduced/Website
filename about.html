                <p class="bioRole">founder & CEO</p>
                <p class="bioText">Ariane Michaud has worked as a producer for over a decade, building and strengthening communities that support the arts and advance social justice. Her passion for dance has led her to diverse roles within the industry, including serving as a producer for DANCE NOW NYC, The Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces, and as the Executive Producer of the Dances with Robots Podcast. Ariane’s expertise is based in strategic planning - she believes that a solid plan is what leads to success. But her true passion is working with others and bringing their vision to life through creative collaborations, especially when those projects involve interdisciplinarity, technology, and crazy (sometimes almost impossible) ideas. 
                    When Ariane isn’t busy sending dancers into space, she is cultivating her passion for movement and mindfulness. She is a practicing dancer, yoga teacher, and occasional van lifer looking for community wherever she goes.

            <p>Ariane was always professional, resourceful, organized, creative, reliable and immensely supportive. She rose to every challenge, providing educational insight, and intuitively understood when necessary steps needed attention.
