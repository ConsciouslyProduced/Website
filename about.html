                <h2>founder & CEO</h2>
                <p>Ariane Michaud has worked as a producer and creative consultant for over a decade, building and
                    strengthening communities that support the arts and advance social justice. Her expertise lies in
                    strategic planning—she believes that a solid plan is the foundation of success. Yet, her true
                    passion is collaborating with others to bring their visions to life, especially when projects
                    involve interdisciplinarity, technology, and bold (sometimes almost impossible) ideas. When Ariane
                    isn’t busy bringing ambitious ideas to life, she’s cultivating her passion for movement and
                    mindfulness. She is a practicing dancer, yoga teacher, and occasional van lifer, always seeking
                    community wherever she goes.</p>

                        needs to go, and how to lead a team to get there. She sees what others miss, and ensures that

                        team member has their needs met so that they can bring their whole selves to work, and

                    <p>Ariane was always professional, resourceful, organized, creative, reliable and immensely
                        supportive.
                        She rose to every challenge, providing educational insight, and intuitively understood when
                        necessary steps needed attention. "How is this working for you? and "How can I help you?" were
                        always her questions for me. I have seen her working in other scenarios, and have always been
                        inspired by her clarity and tenacity.</p>
